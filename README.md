We will use Python and Node to create a Bitcoin trading bot for trending price momentum indicators - fulfilling the requirements of a real, live contract from a popular freelancing marketplace, then test our software using paper trading (testnet on BitMex) and also forward testing performance and profitability using live funds.

What are the requirements?:

Basic cross-language understanding of code (to figure out Python and Node)

Understanding of how to read API documentation

And the most important is: Don’t Panic!

What is the target audience?:

You want to learn how to algorithmically trade

You have your own ideas for strategies you could automate into Bitcoin trading, but don’t know where to start

You’re looking for a new challenge
